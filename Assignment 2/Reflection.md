# Assignment 2 - Poster On Industry Talk 1

## Reflection

### Summary:
The industrial talk that was organized by Clarity Techworks has been of great use to me. I learnt about the working environment in the company and some of the most important position in the company such as the QA Testing Analyst, Junior Android Developer and Junior Web Developer. I am now able to understand their roles and requirement needed to become one.

### Suggestion:
An improvement that I would like to suggest is to highlight more on the common misconception about the job position and goes more in depth on how can a student obtain such a position despite various circumstances.
