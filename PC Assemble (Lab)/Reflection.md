# PC Assemble (Lab)

## Summary:
Through this PC assembly session, I have obtained some experience in PC assembly and reassembly. I am now well aware about the different components of the standard PC which includes the PSU, RAM, SSD, HDD, CPU fan and many more. I have also been made aware of the proper steps to assemble and disassembel the PC parts.

## Suggestion:
I hope the PC assembly session includes all of the components of the PC such as the CPU itself. I understand the risk of letting students install the CPU by themselves (bend pins might happen) but I feel like this is the most crucial part of PC assembly that simply ignoring this steps feels a little bit excessive.
