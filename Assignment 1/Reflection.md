# Assignment 1 - Report on Visit to NALI 2023

## Reflection

### Summary:

I learned a lot about NALI research and innovative products in teaching and learning through workshops and exhibitions during my visit to NALI 2023. I have learned more about the subject of their research through the speaker's presentation and interview at the booth. For instance, studies on the performance, motivation, and vocabulary retention of secondary school students My understanding of the usefulness of implementing augmented reality (AR) for teaching and learning has deepened as a result of the use of AR in English language classrooms. Additionally, as a student studying computer science (graphics and multimedia), I now know how important virtual reality (VR) is to education.

### Suggestion:
One of my suggestion would be to promote events like this to a broader audience because the entire event seemed a little bit gloomy eventhough there are much to be learned by the students. Promotional advertisements for this type of events would comes a long way.
