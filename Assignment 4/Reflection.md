# Assignment 4 - Report on Industrial Talk 2

## Summary:
I learned a lot about the history, technology, and tool usage of Credence's system development from the industrial discussion that was arranged by Ms. Qistina Batrisyia Binti Azman Shah, a Professional AI Operation from TM Subsidiary. In addition, I learned more about Credence's workplace culture. Aside from that, the speaker informed me about careers in analytics, including business analysis, data analysis, data architecture, and data engineering. 

## Suggestion:
I really hope that the speaker goes more in depth about the technologies that are being used in Credence's. This can be useful for students to envisioned the workplace environment provided by Credence. They could also prepared themselves by learning these technologies before getting into a professional work setting so that they won't have any problems to settle in when they got their first job in a pre-established company like Credence.
